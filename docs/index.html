<h2>Milestones</h2> 
Note:
The following paragraphs list many papers that try to contribute to 
the P-versus-NP question.
Among all these papers, there is only <b>a single paper</b> that has 
appeared in a peer-reviewed journal, that has thoroughly been verified 
by the experts in the area, and whose correctness is accepted by the 
general research community: The paper by Mihalis Yannakakis.
(And this paper does not settle the P-versus-NP question, but "just" 
shows that a certain approach to settling this question will never work
out.) 

<ol> 

<li>
<b>[Equal]: </b>
In 1986/87 Ted Swart (University of Guelph) wrote a number of papers 
(some of them had the title: <i>"P=NP"</i>) that gave linear programming 
formulations of polynomial size for the Hamiltonian cycle problem.
Since linear programming is polynomially solvable and Hamiltonian cycle
is NP-hard, Swart deduced that P=NP.

<br>
In 1988, Mihalis Yannakakis closed the discussion with his paper
"Expressing combinatorial optimization problems by linear programs"
(Proceedings of STOC 1988, pp. 223-228).
Yannakakis proved that expressing the traveling salesman problem by a 
symmetric linear program (as in Swart's approach) requires exponential 
size. 
The 
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-0000(91)90024-Y">
journal version</a> of this paper has been published in
Journal of Computer and System Sciences 43, 1991, pp. 441-466.

<i>"Polynomial-Time Partition of a Graph into Cliques"</i>
by the Ukrainian mathematician 
<a href="http://www.vinnica.ua/~aplot/">
Anatoly Plotnikov.</a> 
This article designs a polynomial time algorithm for an NP-hard 
graph problem, and thus proves P=NP.

(SWJPAM is an electronic journal devoted to all aspects of 
Pure and Applied mathematics, and related topics. 
Authoritative expository and survey articles on subjects of

SWJPAM serves as an international forum for the publication of 
high-quality strictly peer-reviewed original research articles. 
The article is usually sent to at least two experts in the area.
Two positive reviews are required for the acceptance and 
publication of any submitted article.)

<b>[Equal]: </b>
Around 1997 Tang Pushan provided a polynomial algorithm for the clique problem.
The two relevant papers are
<i>"An algorithm with polynomial time complexity for finding clique in a graph"</i>
by Tang Pushan (Proceedings of 5th International Conference on CAD&amp;CG;, Shenzhen, 
P.R. China, 1997, pp 500-505) and
<i>"HEWN: A polynomial algorithm for CLIQUE problem"</i>
by Tang Pushan and Huang Zhijun (Journal of Computer Science &amp; Technology 13(Supplement), 
1998, pp 33-44). 
Clearly this implies P=NP.

<br>
Zhu Daming, Luan Junfeng and M. A. Shaohan (all affiliated with Shandong University, China)
refute these claims in their paper

The proof of this theorem has been derived in the second half of the

<b>[Equal]: </b>
In May 2002 Charles Sauerbier designed a polynomial time algorithm for
the satisfiability problem.  
This algorithm employs an unconventional approach premised on set theory 
(which does not use search or resolution) to partition the set of all 
assignments into nonsatisfying and satisfying assignments. 
The 
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.CC/0205064">
paper</a>
<i>"A polynomial time (heuristic) SAT algorithm"</i>
can be found at the "arXiv.org e-Print archive".
<br>
In September 2003, a hole has been found in the algorithm: 
An eleventh hour change admits a path inconsistency. 
The inconsistency arises due to an improper closure of a path to a cycle 
against a root not supportive of the path. The mathematical basis of the 
algorithm remains supportive of the intended solution, and a revision 
of the algorithm is underway.

Here is a link to a
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.CC/0303008">

The title of the paper is
<i>"Solution of the Linear Ordering Problem (NP=P)"</i>.
The paper has been archived in March 2003 at the
"arXiv.org e-Print archive".

<br>
An earlier version of this paper appeared in 1990 in the 
journal "Soobshcheniya Akademii Nauk Gruzinskoi SSR" under the title 
<i>"A polynomial algorithm for a problem of linear orders"</i>.
This version was written in Russian with an English and a Georgian 
summary.

<b>[Undecidable]: </b>
Nicholas Argall proved on 25 March 2003 that P=NP is undecidable.
His main line of argument is that a provable answer to the P=NP question 
requires a complete and consistent formal statement of the question.
Then he invokes Goedel's theorem and deduces that P=NP is undecidable.
The proof is actually quite short:

<i>"Proof by contradiction. Assume P=NP. 
Let y be a proof that P=NP. The proof y can be verified

<br>
Richard K. Molnar, the reviewer of this paper in the AMS Mathematical 
Reviews, writes in his review MR2038228 (2005e:68070):
<i>"The crux is the assertion that the problem is not solvable in polynomial
time because the relevant system of equations contains expressions not just
determined from the data but also random variables.
The calculations are lengthy, complex, and difficult to follow, and the
assertion of non-computability in polynomial time is not convincing to the
reviewer."</i>

In the essay <i>"Some consequences of defining mathematical objects 
constructively and mathematical truth effectively"</i> from 2004, 
Bhupinder Singh Anand considers a constructive interpretation of 
classical first order theory in which he argues that the class P of
polynomial-time languages in the P-versus-NP problem may define a
mathematical concept that cannot be added as a formal mathematical 
symbol to the theory without inviting contradiction.

<br>
In the paper <i>"A density-based approach for non-heuristic approximations 
of prime counting functions"</i> from 2015,
Bhupinder Singh Anand shows that the prime divisors of any integer n are 
mutually independent, and concludes that any deterministic algorithm 
which always computes a prime factor of n is necessarily of the order 
O(n/log n). Hence Integer Factorising cannot be polynomial-time, 
whence P is not equal to NP.

Marius Ionescu has written a
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0409039">
paper</a>
with the title <i>"P is not NP"</i>.
The paper has been archived in September 2004.
It introduces the OWMF (One Way Mod Function) problem.
It shows that OWMF is in NP, but cannot be solved in polynomial
time, since there is no faster algorithm other then exhaustive
search for it.
<br>
Marius Ionescu also maintains a web-page
<a href="http://1wayfx.com./">http://1wayfx.com</a>
where he applies his results on the "P versus NP" question
to cryptographic systems.
In particular, Ionescu uses his insights into the 1WayFx Model to
construct the MI cryptosystem, a unique new security solution,
without the need of SSL, PKI, or third party involvement.
The MI cryptosystem solves today's major implementation issues,
including difficulty of deployment, data/message integrity, security
exposure, and performance.

In October 2004, Moustapha Diaby constructed a linear programming 
formulation for the travelling salesman problem (TSP).
His paper is called <i>"P=NP: Linear Programming Formulation of the 
Traveling Salesman Problem"</i>, and it is available at 
<a href="http://www.business.uconn.edu/users/mdiaby/tsplp/">
http://www.business.uconn.edu/users/mdiaby/tsplp/</a>.
The correctness of Diaby's proof is frequently discussed in the 
newsgroup comp.theory.
In reaction to these discussions in comp.theory, the paper has
been revised and clarified many times.

In October 2005, Moustapha Diaby also constructed a linear programming
formulation of the QAP (quadratic assignment problem).
This yields yet another proof that P=NP.

This version was also awarded a "Certficate of Merit Award" by the conference organizers (IAENG).

<br>
In 2010, Moustapha Diaby provided two further proofs for P=NP.
His papers

give linear programming formulations for two well-known NP-hard problems.
Both papers were published in the "International Journal of Operational Research (IJOR)".

In April 2016, Moustapha Diaby and Mark H Karwan published the book <i>"Advances in Combinatorial Optimization "</i>

is in the complexity class NP, but not in P.
(Another interesting result in this paper states that the Halting 
problem is effectively solvable, albeit not algorithmically.)

<i>"Complexity Theory for Simpletons"</i></a>.
This paper explains why P is not equal to NP in the so-called Mabel-Mildred-Feinstein 
model of computation. 
The paper also kind of settles the Collatz 3n+1 Conjecture:
Every valid proof in the Feinstein-model-of-proof must have an infinite number of lines.
A similar statement is shown to hold for the Riemann Hypothesis.

The title of the paper is <i>"P is a proper subset of NP"</i>.
The paper demonstrates that as the number of clauses in a NP-complete problem 
approaches infinity, the number of input sets processed per computations performed 
also approaches infinity when solved by a polynomial time solution. 
It is then possible to determine that the only deterministic optimization of an 
NP-complete problem that could prove P=NP would be one that examines no more than 
a polynomial number of input sets for a given problem. 
By demonstrating that at least one NP-complete problem exists that can not be solved 
by checking a polynomial subset of the total set of possible input sets, it then 
follows that P is not equal to NP.

He writes:
<i>"Using rigorous interval analysis, rather than non-rigorous floatingpoint 
computations, we can estimate the integral, as well as bound the error, thereby 
solving the problem in 'polynomial' time. 
The rigorous estimate of the error (crucial to the success of the decision algorithm), 
involves solving more than ten thousand Linear Programming problems, each with more 
than one hundred thousand variables. 
This system was generated automatically and dynamically, using a genetic algorithm 
and simulated annealing, as well as sophisticated Markov Chains and Bayesian analysis. 
Of course, we do not guarantee that this is the shortest possible proof, since it was 
generated by a non-determinstic Turing machine, but it is indeed a fully rigorous proof. 
The validity of the proof was independently checked by four other computers, running on
different platforms and different programming languages."</i>

He writes:
<i>The state space of a non-deterministic finite automaton is evolving due to the 
computation itself hence it cannot be efficiently contracted using a deterministic 
finite automaton that will arrive at a solution in super-polynomial time. 
The solution of the NP problem itself is verifiable in polynomial time (P) because 
the corresponding state is stationary. Likewise the class P set of states does not 
depend on computational history hence it can be efficiently contracted to the 
accepting state by a deterministic sequence of dissipative transformations. 
Thus it is concluded that the class P set of states is inherently smaller than 
the set of class NP. </i>

In 2009, Narendra S. Chaudhari designed a constructive procedure for solving the 3-SAT 
problem in polynomial time O(n^13).
The main trick lies in the representation that allows Chaudhari to cast the 3-SAT problem in 
terms of the CLAUSES and not the literals. 
The complexity is fundamentally different because the mapping from literals to clauses is 
exponential while from clauses to 3-SAT is linear.

In the beginning of August 2010, Vinay Deolalikar announced a proof that
P is not equal to NP.
<br>
He writes:<i>
"The proof required the piecing together of principles from multiple areas within 
mathematics.  The major effort in constructing this proof was uncovering a chain 
of conceptual links between various fields and viewing them through a common lens.  
Second to this were the technical hurdles faced at each stage in the proof.
This work builds upon fundamental contributions many esteemed researchers have made 
to their fields. In the presentation of this paper, it was my intention to provide 
the reader with an understanding of the global framework for this proof.  Technical 
and computational details within chapters were minimized as much as possible."</i>

In July 2012, Satoshi Tazawa proved that P is not equal to NP. 
The proof establishes that the decision problem version of integer factorization problem is neither in P nor NP-complete.
From this result, the conclusion that P is not NP is reached.

Later versions of this paper carry the title <i>"Relationship between circuit complexity and symmetry"</i>.
The paper shows that by interpreting a Boolean circuit as a graph, the small number of graph automorphisms and the large 
number of subgraph automorphisms in the circuit establishes the exponential circuit lower bound for NP-complete problems. 
As this strategy violates the largeness condition in Natural proof, this result shows that P!=NP without any contradictions 
to the existence of pseudorandom functions.

In July 2012, Wen-Qi Duan proved that P=NP.
His paper <i>"A Constructive Algorithm to Prove P=NP"</i>
first reduces the undirected Hamiltonian cycle problem into the TSP problem with cost 0 or 1, and then
develops an effective algorithm to compute the optimal tour of the transformed TSP.
This yields a polynomial time algorithm for the undirected Hamiltonian cycle problem, and established P=NP.

In February 2014, Peng Cui proved P=NP.
The main ingredients of the paper include a key issue in dictator test that disguises the questions 
of the verifier to a balanced pairwise independent distribution and a variance-style theorem to eliminate 
correlation of answers of all players based on Label-Cover and its reflection version, which does not 
rely on the technique of direct sum that requires the subgroup property. 
On the other hand, the author shows that the gap problem of this type of k-CSP can be solved by a SDP 
algorithm in polynomial time efficiently, when the support of C is combined by the grounds of three 
truncated biased pairwise independent distributions and the three biases satisfy certain conditions.

The proof uses an artificially designed Turing Machine that generates the instances of the satisfiability problem,

not have without the assumption. This leads to P not equal NP, by modus tollens.

In June 2015, Frank Vega introduced a new complexity class (called <i>equivalent-P</i>), which 
has a close relation to the P-versus-NP question.
The class equivalent-P has those languages that contain ordered pairs of instances, where each 
one belongs to a specific problem in P, such that the two instances share a same solution, that 
is, the same certificate. 
Vega then demonstrates that (i) equivalent-P = NP and (ii) equivalent-P = P. 
These two statements clearly imply P=NP.

In October 2015, Yubin Huang proved the following:
For any language L accepted by a non-deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time, there exists a
deterministic Turing machine that accepts L in polynomial time.
A restricted Turing machine, whose maximum number of nondeterministic moves in the accept computation
tree of inputs is limited, is constructed and studied.
This limitation establishes a hierarchy of classes associated with natural numbers between P and NP.
Any language in NP is also accepted by machines in each of these classes, and P forms the lowest hierarchy level.

In March 2016, Steven Meyer established P=NP.
Meyer solves the P-versus-NP problem philosophically by showing P is equal to NP in the random 
access with unit multiply (MRAM) model.
More precisely, the P-versus-NP problem is shown to be a scientific rather than a mathematical problem.
The assumptions involved in the current definition of the P-versus-NP problem as a problem involving 
non deterministic Turing Machines (NDTMs) from axiomatic automata theory are criticized. 
The problem is also shown to be neither a problem in pure nor applied mathematics.

Arroyo-Figueroa establishes the existence of a certain class of one-way functions that are

by any polynomial probabilistic algorithm. 
This is accomplished by constructing each member in T with a collection of independent universal

random bit matrices. 
The existence of one-way functions implies that P is not equal to NP.
