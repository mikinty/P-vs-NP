# The P vs NP Page

One of humanity's biggest problems is `P vs NP`.

`116 ways to solve P=NP` was one of my favorite sites that hosted a bunch of notable attempts to crack P vs. NP, before 
[Dr. Gerhard Woeginger](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10951-022-00748-4) 
passed away in 2022. Since then, the original site directs to his memorial page.

This is my favorite problem, and I'd like to keep a site alive for people to see what progress has been made on the problem.

If you'd like to submit a new paper, please submit a PR and I will try to maintain this as much as possible.

## TODO

- Even though the original site was a pure HTML page, I would like to make this site
  - More modern-looking
  - Mobile friendly
  - Searchable
